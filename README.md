**Function**

Clicky is a memory testing game designed to test the photographic memory of the user. Once a click on an image is made the deck of images will be shuffled randomly. The program then stores in memory that a click has been made to that specific image. If the user clicks the same image more than once the game ends.  The goal of the game is to remember images that you have clicked before and only click on the ones that have not previously clicked. Hence each unique click will result in increment of points. The program also maintains a top score as well to keep the user challenged.
